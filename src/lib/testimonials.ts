			"As a large agency with numerous orders across Kazakhstan, we highly value qualified contractors who don't need constant reminders and with whom it's easy and efficient to collaborate. And if they are also creative, helping to implement complex projects such as applications, websites, portals, and chatbots—then it's absolutely perfect. We have been working with Gleb for several years, successfully delivering many large-scale projects. Whenever I prepare tender documentation, even for the most demanding clients, I have complete confidence in Gleb and his team. I involve him in projects, along with the specialists he recommends, knowing that over the years, he has proven himself in the best possible way.",

			"Gleb pleasantly surprised me with the speed of his development. When I reached out to him just three weeks before an event with the urgent need to create an application (or something similar), I understood how challenging the task was. However, the amount of work that was successfully completed within that short timeframe exceeded all my expectations. Looking back, I realize that choosing a single experienced developer like Gleb was the best decision I could have made at that moment. Working with an agency would likely have been much more complicated.",

Developing chatbots for major promotions in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Each time, I discover new skills and talents in Gleb during our collaboration. His deep knowledge of marketing, analytics, and design makes working with him not only efficient but also truly enjoyable.",
